{"name":"Polarity","tagline":"An HTML5 Canvas experiment","body":"Polarity\r\n===========\r\nThe doodle above was created for the Software Structures for User Interfaces (SSUI) class at Carnegie Mellon University, and inspired by Google doodles. The basic motivation was to experiment with the HTML5 canvas element and envision what magnetic typography might look like. The code was adapted from a post by Tim Holman: `http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/09/interactive-html5-typography/`.\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n-----------\r\n+ `Hover mouse` over doodle to agitate magnetic typographic particles.\r\n+ `Click mouse` to trigger magnetic pole change.\r\n+ `Hold mouse left button down` to activate magnetic attraction action and trigger magnetic pole change.\r\n+ `Release mouse button` to activate magnetic repulsion action.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
