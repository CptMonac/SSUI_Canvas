Polarity
===========
The doodle above was inspired by google doodles. The basic motivation for the doodle is to experiment with the HTML5 canvas and to envision what magnetic typography might look like. The code was adapted from a post by Tim Holman: `http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/09/interactive-html5-typography/`.

How to use
-----------
+ `Hover mouse` over doodle to agitate magnetic typographic particles.
+ `Click mouse` to trigger magnetic pole change.
+ `Hold mouse left button down` to activate magnetic attraction action and trigger magnetic pole change.
+ `Release mouse button` to activate magnetic repulsion action.
